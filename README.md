## 🚀 What I Learned

My biggest takeaway from this project is learning how to direct the user's attention towards a specific block or line. This helps the website more approachable and carry intended messages across the user. 

Other aspects would be that tiny intuitive animations makes the website a lot more responsive as well as the follwings:
- Semantic HTML and modular CSS
- CSS transitions, hover effects, and pseudo-classes
- Building responsive UI using only HTML and CSS
- Creative visual layout techniques using background layers and z-index
- Writing accessible, clean and readable front-end code
